# giterature #

for giterate authors

Harness the power and beauty of github to publish, document and maintain your work.

I'm trying out the principles [here](https://github.com/monkybrain/literature).

### dogma / manifesto ###

Experimenting with a manifesto, like dogme 95 for film in the 90s. Still working on it. Please contribute!

* Rapid iterations (with [giterate](https://github.com/monkybrain/giterate) or similar tool)
* Radical openness
* Open source tools only
* A simple markdown editor is enough (no fancy word processors)
* Followers can contribute via pull requests (for contributions, proofreading etc)
* Text organized using directory structure (e.g. /novel/chapter_about_fishes/README.md)
* Publishing means updating current README.md (no finalizing...)
* No horizontal links, only vertical
* Use reddit to upvote/downvote projects, chapters, plotlines etc.

### status ###
hack!
