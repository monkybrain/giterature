# sharing is daring #

This is my first ever blog post. For someone who's spent most of his life thinking, reading and analysing everything around him that's rather odd. An endless torrent of input swirling around inside that lopsided, bony head just waiting to materialise. That's the problem: input creates a need for output and considering the amount of conflicting information and world views I carry inside, I have to start synthesising this stuff now if I'm to stay (become ed.) sane. And as input requires output, so does output require prefer a receiver than being sent into the void. I'm not sure anybody has time for my thoughts, but thought I'd better post this stuff onto the internet than slowly letting it run down that narrow drainpipe which is time. (too pretentious? probably)
