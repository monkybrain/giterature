# sharing is daring #

This is my first ever blog post. For someone who's spent most of his life thinking, reading and analysing everything around him that's rather odd. An endless torrent of input swirling around inside that lopsided, bony head just waiting to materialise into something. Because that's the problem: input creates a need for output and considering the amount of conflicting world views I harbour inside, I have to start synthesise this stuff if I'm to stay sane.
