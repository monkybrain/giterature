# code monkey koans

just being silly...

`if true? then false? is true`

`true == beauty `

`isNaN(∞)` (see answer below...)

`if typeof(∞) is null then mind.fuck()`

`if (true + false) is (false + true) then why bother`

`for i have not showered today...`


`isNaN('indian bread') === true`

```
# Animate this...

console.log(isNaN(∞))
> false
console.log(∞)
> 42
